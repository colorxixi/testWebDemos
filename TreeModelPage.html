            <h2> Attention to the forest</h2>
            <p> I assume everyone have the sense that forest plays an influential role in the terrestrial
                ecological systems; just considering their coverage around 30 percent of total land area.
                I have paid special attentions to trees. It is not because I am doing research
                on it so I have to. Trees just matter every moment they are on this earth.
                When I set my first step to US in 2011, I was straightly touched by the large coverage of
                vital dense forests with more than 20 feet in height here in Columbus. More than 17
                metropolitan parks can be visited for free in a one-day trip. I can collect 17 tour brochures in one park site.
                This really makes me shocked. I am not the single case among all my Chinese friends
                who have buried anxiety deep in heart, the anxiety that our habitats in China may run out of tree covers.
                I keep silent each time when the news goes about how China is struggling with the extreme weather and
                how people's complaints rage around. My mother told me she prayed in front of Buddhas many times for fear of
                disasters and miseries and she felt blessed that my hometown suffered from less abnormal weather conditions.
                I will thank her for her pious belief but mom, this is not your responsibility but everyone's.
                </br></br>
                Many scientists around the world are making efforts to  monitor the status and the change of the trees
                that may determine our future life. I just tried to grab a droplet of the sea by applying remote sensing
                technology to forestry. I will start from parametrizing forest trees with biophysical variables, touch on
                the current methods to retrieve biophysical variables and then raise my own points of interest.
                </br></br>
                To wake up, I'd like to share this <a href="TreeModelSim.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="color:red;">
                demo1</span> </a> first. We can notice there is a bunch of yellow particles being emitted at certain time
                interval. I intend to use this particles to represent the photon rays from the sum. When a photon reaches
                the surface of an object (atmosphere/vegetation/ground or whatever), it has a probability of becoming absorbed,
                reflected or transmitted. The reflectance can be specular or diffuse. My demo just simulates the behavior of
                specular reflectance, diffuse reflectance and transmission, without consider absorption. The outgoing reflectance
                can be captured by the remote sensing instrument and can be further processed into product.
                </br></br>
                When you move the objects(i.e. the branches and sphere) to a different location, the reflectance behavior
                correspondingly differs. Although I did not add the leaves to the trees, I just want to use this very
                simple demonstration to show that, the structure of trees will affect the reflectance behavior to a great
                degree. Changing the geometry of sun light incident angle, the tree structure and any other settings will
                change the directional reflectance. From this perspective, it is possible to model the relationship between
                the forest information and the remote sensing product.
                <!--<a href="#" class="read_more">Read More</a>-->
            </p>
            <h2>Forest information? How can I get?</h2>
            <p>
                There are plenty of forest parameters to take care of.
                Physically: species, development stage, coverage, height, crown closure, crown size, crown depth,
                stem density, basal area, Diameter breast height (DBH), leaf area index (LAI), crown/leaf clumping index,
                fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), biomass, Net primary productivity, age,
                height of the first live branch, subcanopy/understory diversity, etc.
                Chemically: chlorophyll content, water content, leaf nitrogen, chlorophyll fluorescence, fire fuel, etc.
                </br></br>
                These physical/chemical variables can be measured in certain ways which represent the change and status of
                forest. The question is that field samples of these variables are usually very limited. A promising solution is
                to infer these variables continuously from the existing remote sensing products with broad temporal and spatial coverage.
                Basically, the <span style="color:red;text-decoration:none;">two figures</span> below give a glimpse of
                two prototypes of retrieving forest variables from remote sensing reflectance product.

                    <div id="figure_curr_method"></div>
                    <p>Figure 2. Another approach to retrieving forest information.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Generally, statistical
                models or physical models are built to estimate the unknown values of forest variables from the known.
                Various statistical models, e.g. regression, and statistical learning models, provide fast and effective
                means of such estimation as long as forest samples are sufficient. In parallel to the statistical models,
                the so-called physical models, stem from physical principles such as radiosity, radiative transfer,
                geometrical optics, or computer ray tracing. In their first step, these sophisticated models usually
                quantify a scene presumably composed of trees and the ground with the physical/chemical parameters like LAI, leaf angle,
                chlorophyll, etc. The spectral property such as reflectance and transmission behavior of a scene unit is
                also defined based on a-priori knowledge. The aforementioned physical principles are then constructed
                in the form of equations or recursions, which tie the physical/chemical variables and remotely sensed radiations
                together. The construction is usually in the forward direction from the radiation source to the receptors.
                Our target process is actually in the inverse direction so that we can get physical/chemical variables from
                the remotely sensed reflectance. In this situation, the statistical models can be useful to model this
                inverse process. The inversion results are the forest physical/chemical variables. Despite the complexity of
                the physical models, the requirement for forest samples are minimized and validation of a physical model is doable.
                Studying and applying the physical models has draw constant attention in remote sensing.
            </p>
            <h2> Something promising</h2>
            <p>
                The <a href="TreeModelSim.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="color:red;">
                demo1</span> </a> shows a simplified principle of the computer-based simulation models to render an object.
                Actually, the computer-based simulation models are held to be more accurate than other types of physical
                models and therefore have great implication for correcting other physical models. One detailed example
                can be found in<sup> <a href="http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart.html" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">
                <span style="color:red;"> [1]</span> </a></sup>.
            </br></br>
                However, this important linkage between the micro-scale tree characteristics to macro-scale reflectance information
                has not been self-contained due to the simplicity of the tree geometries and many other factors. The encyclopedic
                library for diverse tree species seem to be set aside so far. On the other hand, the rapid development of sensing
                technology, especially airborne and terrestrial LiDAR, has tremendously enabled the field of tree reconstruction
                into a practical stage. A huge gap is formed. Not too bad, I still find several strong teams are doing this research topics
                <sup><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/greg_asner_ecology_from_the_air.html#!" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><span style="color:red;">
                [2]</span> </a> <a href="http://blog.geog.ucl.ac.uk/blog-entries/gabon-quantifying-forest-structure?goback=%2Egde_1317037_member_5802684013751582720#%21" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="color:red;">
                [3]</span> </a></sup>. I am so thrilled at their breakthroughs and I just cannot help trying to throw myself in the air. Computers
                can offer us details and we cannot ignore this great power.
            </p>
            <h2> My point goes here---Branches!</h2>
            <p> The simplicity of tree geometries such as random distribution of leaves need be revised based on the integration of point clouds
                and radiance measurements. The tree geometries requires covering more accurate tree distribution functions,
                leaf distribution functions, dynamics of leaves and flowers, orientations of leaves, bare trunk influence.
                In fact, leaves grow under strong constraint of their branches. The count, alignment and orientation of leaves and their
                growing pattern are definitely impacted by the branch spatial properties. These rules can be observed and stored as
                prior information database with species as a key. Since it is possible to have species classifications in a 3D scene based on
                surveys or any other techniques as well as the rich spatial and spectral information, we can reconstruct the real
                forest scene with the aid of computer algorithms. The results are tree structure database and we can obtain
                the real statistics for the metrics that we are interested in.
                </br></br>
                At least three contributions can be made by such research:</br>
                1) Providing true leaf area for LAI measurement.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional labor for trapping leaf litters to measure LAI can be minimized. Branch based LAI estimates
                will effectively address the overlapping effect of leaves.</br>

                2) Simulating the dynamics of greening and defoliation more accurately.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing and falling of leaves are not sudden. They keep a certain order to turn dense or sparse.</br>

                3) Quantifying the visible tree responses to environmental factors.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bias of branch directions is affected by water resource and light hours. More unknown macro metrics of branches
                that relates to environmental factors are worth research attentions.</br>

                4) Exposing animal, fire and other factors that cause forest disturbance.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scanning technology achieves amazement by capturing some small-scale objects that used to be invisible.

            <h2> Working now</h2>
            Thank you for your patience since you reach here! I just want to share my current progress (
            <a href="TreeModelGuide.html" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><span style="color:red;">
                demo2</span> </a>) here. Note that this demo consists of four scenes, with raw point clouds filtered by its peaks as Figure 1,
            classified trunks as Figure 2, skeletonized trunks as Figure 3, and a pilot grown mesh as Figure 4.
            Actually, I am not satisfied with the point data resolution, and it makes the skeletonization algorithm unsmooth.
            But it is the best I can offer at present.
            </br></br>
            <span style="color:blue;">[-- updated Jan.7.2014]</span> </a> I have added <a href="TreeModelLeaf.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">
            <span style="color:red;">demo3</span> </a> and <a href="TreeModelLeaves.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">
            <span style="color:red;">demo4</span> </a> to illustrate the geometric modeling of leaf and scene. Something
            playable is the simulation of leaf bend factor, leaf angle distribution, leaf and crown position distribution. The
            two demos do not reflect anything real but does follow the distribution assumptions of some studies about building
            physical models. These studies also assume that a pixel in a remote sensed image can be decomposed to shadow area,
            and sunlit area. The total reflectance is a sum of the reflectance from shadow and from sunlit area if the reflected light
            does not scatter multiple times. The assumptions about distribution and reflectance can apply in large scales,
            but not in this high resolution case. As seen from the simple <a href="TreeModelLeaf.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">
            <span style="color:red;">demo3</span> </a> and <a href="TreeModelLeaves.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">
            <span style="color:red;">demo4</span> </a>, when you try a change of bend factor, the shadow will change drastically and the calculation of shadow area will be challenged.
            </br></br>
            In essence, the reflectance can be more accurately calculated using the ray tracing technology, based on the
            radiative transfer equation, or called the rendering equation in computer graphics.
            <blockquote>
                \( L_0(p,w_0) = L_e(p,w_0) + \int_{2\pi^+}f_r(p,w_i,w_0)L_0(r_c(p,w_i),-w_i)cos\theta_idw_i \)
            </blockquote>
            Devoid of atmosphere, \( L_0 \) is the outgoing radiance, \( p \) is the ray hit point,  \( w_0 \) is the ray outgoing direction,
            \( L_e \) is the self-emitted radiance from the ray hit point, \( f_r \) is the BRDF, \( w_i \) is the incident ray direction
            at the hit point, \( r_c \) is the backward ray hit point. The detailed explanation can be found in Suffen 2007<sup><span style="color:red;">
            [4]</span></sup>.
            </br></br>
            Combining ray tracing with trunk and leaf geometric modeling, a realistic scene for forest monitoring and ecological analysis is within reach.
